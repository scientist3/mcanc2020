      -(Client) Browser request (URL:localhost/pathOfFileWithExtension)
        -> (Server) Apache(XAMP) - Accepts the request and Locates the requested file in %driveXampIsInstalled%/xampp/htdocs/pathOfFileWithExtension
          -> PassesThisFileThrough "xampp/php/php.exe" * - which processes the php code in this file and generates the result code(HTML) which you may call as DATA.
            -> return the result code or DATA.

      -> (Client) Browser recieves the Data, interprets the data and displays the data with effects.
      
      - This the complete cycle From Request To Response of PHP scritp

      Note for asterisk(*)
      * In this phase php file is compiled first then interpreted. 
        Only that Process Data is sent back which we want to Output by using output function like echo.
