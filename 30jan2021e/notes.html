    - $_GET and $_POST:
      - Both GET and POST create an array (e.g. array( key1 => value1, key2 => value2, key3 => value3, ...)). 
        - This array holds key/value pairs, 
          * where keys are the names of the form controls and 
          * values are the input data from the user.
      - Both GET and POST are treated as $_GET and $_POST.
        - These are superglobals, which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope
          * you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.

      - $_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.
        * Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone 
          (all variable names and values are displayed in the URL).
        * GET also has limits on the amount of information to send. 
        * The limitation is about 2000 characters.
        * GET may be used for sending non-sensitive data.

      - $_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.
        * Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others 
          (all names/values are embedded within the body of the HTTP request)
        * POST has no limits on the amount of information to send.
        * POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input 
          while uploading files to server.
