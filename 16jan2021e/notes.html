    -Conditional Statements (If, If else and Switch)
      - perform different actions for different conditions.
      -In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

      * if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
      if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
      
      * if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
      
      *switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed
    </Control>

    -Loops 
      - In PHP, we have the following loop types:

      * while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
        - Syntax
          while (condition is true) {
            code to be executed;
          }
      * do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
        - Syntax
          do {
            code to be executed;
          } while (condition is true);
      
      * for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
        - Syntax
          for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
            code to be executed for each iteration;
          }

      * foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
        - Syntax
          foreach ($array as $value) {
            code to be executed;
          }
        - Example
          <?php
            $colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");

            foreach ($colors as $value) {
              echo "$value <br>";
            }
          ?>
    </Looping>
