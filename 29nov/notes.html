Web - Connected Computers -> Sharing -> Data(Text,Multimedia- Images, Videos, Docs)
    Everything in computer is ->File (Realated Data packed)
        Example Image file.
    Through Files - Files are Connected -> HT(ML)
    HT- Hyper -> jumpable from one file to another 
        Text -> data
        HyperText -> text which allows to jump from one file to another.

        Hyper text is stored in one kind of file, designed/ Layout, markup(style, size)  
                -> filename.html
        understood application -> browsers( Chrome, IE, EDGE, FIREFOX, many)

       Doc  named as html document ->Commands for browser -> commands to computer.

HTML -> gives us structure of Page/Doc/Web Page, Not so much adv designing flexable structure, not Data Processing
CSS -> Cascading Style Sheets-> Advance Styling to HTML

JS -> JavaScript ->Interactiveness to HTML Pages

PHP -> For Processing Data/Computation
    -> same syntax as c c++.
