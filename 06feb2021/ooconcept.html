  A) Object oriented concepts, 
    <Def>
      Object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

      Prev: Procedural programming ->which is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data.

      - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
      - OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
      - create reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.
    </Adv>
    <def>
      A class is defined by using the <CODE>class</CODE> keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces ({}). All its properties and methods go inside the braces:
    </def>
    <Syntax>
      <?php
        class Fruit {
          // code goes here...
        }
        ?>
    </Syntax>
    <Example>
      <?php
        class Fruit {
          
        }
        ?>
    </Example>
    <Note>
      - Note: In a class, variables are called properties and functions are called methods!

  B) Define a class:
  C) Class 
  D) Creating an Object,
  E) Object properties, 
  F) Object Methods, 
  G) Object constructors and destructors, 
  H) Static Method, 
  I) Class Inheritance, 
  J) Abstract Class
  
The four pillars for OOP are Abstraction, Encapsulation,
Inheritance,Polymorphism. 

Abstraction : Abstraction is the process of showing
only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information. 

Encapsulation : Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method) together into a single unit i.e. class.

Inheritance : The ability of
creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the property of another object. 

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means "many forms". A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class.
